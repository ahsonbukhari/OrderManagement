# OrderManagement
Simple API for customer and order management...

Changes I would make for a PRD ready solution:

1- Implement dependency injection...
2- Use EntityFramework depending on the team direction...
3- Apply transaction handling...
4- Implement Error Logging
5- Detailed diagnostic e.g. App Insights
6- Write Unit Tests for both the Domain project as well as the Api project...
7- Secure the API using some security mechanism e.g. API Key etc...
8- Move settings to the appSettings file such as ConnectionString etc...
9- Remove unnecessary files, code, using statements etc...

# Database

I haven't written the database part of the solution either in the essence of time. For a PRD ready solution of course it would either be a set of tables, STPs, views or EntityFramework based set up.
